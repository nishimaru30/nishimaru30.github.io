  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m Nishi Maru, a computational chemist with a passion for data-driven science, machine learning, and digital chemistry. 
    With a strong foundation in organic chemistry and cheminformatics, I aim to bridge the gap between experimental chemistry 
    and computational modeling.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie PhD fellow at the University of Groningen, working on data-driven catalyst design 
    as part of the CATALOOP doctoral network. Prior to this, I worked at Aganitha Cognitive Solutions on early-stage drug 
    discovery and predictive analytics, and briefly pursued graduate studies at the University of Utah in digital chemistry.

  <p>
    Outside of work, I enjoy writing, storytelling, learning new languages, and exploring the intersections of science and creativity.
